Builder

Builder pattern builds  complex object using simple objects and using
a step by step approach.

IMPLEMENTATION

Interfaces:

Item
Packing

Concrete classes implementing interface Packing:

Packing::Bottle
Packing::Wrapper

Abstract classes implementing interface Item:

Item::Burger
Item::ColdDrink

Concrete classes extending Item::Burger and Item::ColdDrink:

Item::Burger::VegBurger
Item::Burger::ChickenBurger
Item::ColdDrink::Coke
Item::ColdDrink::Pepsi

In the end we have Meal and MealBuilder to builds the complex object.
