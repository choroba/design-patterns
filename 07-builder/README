Builder

Builder pattern builds  complex object using simple objects and using
a step by step approach.

IMPLEMENTATION

Interfaces:

1. Item
2. Packing

Concrete classes implementing interface Packing:

1. Packing::Bottle
2. Packing::Wrapper

Abstract classes implementing interface Item:

1. Item::Burger
2. Item::ColdDrink

Concrete classes extending Item::Burger and Item::ColdDrink:

1. Item::Burger::VegBurger
2. Item::Burger::ChickenBurger
3. Item::ColdDrink::Coke
4. Item::ColdDrink::Pepsi

In the end we have Meal and MealBuilder to builds the complex object.
