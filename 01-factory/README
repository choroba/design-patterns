Factory

In Factory  pattern, we  create  object without exposing the creation
logic to  the client and refer to newly created object using a common
interface.

IMPLEMENTATION

Interface:

1. Shape

Concrete classes implementing interface Shape:

1. Shape::Circle
2. Shape::Square
3. Shape::Rectangle

In the end factory generator ShapeFactory::getShape().
