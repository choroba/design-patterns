Factory

In Factory  pattern, we  create  object without exposing the creation
logic to  the client and refer to newly created object using a common
interface.

Implementation

Interface: Shape

Concrete class implementing interface Shape:

Shape::Circle
Shape::Square
Shape::Rectangle

In the end factory generator ShapeFactory::getShape().
